## About the Project
### Overview

__AirBnB__ is a complete _web application_, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface.

The main aim of this project is to make a command interpreter that manages our AirBnB objects and is comprised of the following sections:-

> #### i. Console

> This is where Objects are created, files are serialized and where the first storage engine i.e., __The File Storage__ is created.

> #### ii. HTML

> This component consists of the visual interface for the future User. It mainly makes things pretty.

> #### iii. MYSQL

> It is a form storage. Other than JSON database, this is new type of database that allows unique ways to help in the burst storage of Objects.

> #### iv. Deployment of HTML with fabric

> This is where all the code is then deployed to a server.

> #### v. Flask Web Application Server

> The models that are in storage are interated with the HTML

> #### vi. Rest API

> This allows things that are object form and converts them into the JSON Format.

> #### vii. Web Dynamic

> The JSON API is integrated with the HTML to allow sharing of the completed project with other people.
